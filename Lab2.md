2\. The most important reason to choose a license is to actually make your software open. If no license is directly defined your code is left as all rights reserved and is not able to be used by anyone else. Also choosing a license allows the creator to define how and in what way their code can be used. 

3\. If a project doesn't have an explicit license then it is for legal purposes all rights reserved. This means that even if the creator wanted it to be "open source" it legally is not. The lack of a license also makes terms of use unclear, how and in what way you can use the code, which could lead to the code not being useable.
